args:

  required: true
  help: "Command to be profiled"

flags:
- long: --freq
  short: -F
  arg: int
  default: "10"
  help: "Sampling frequency per second for on-CPU time profiling"
- long: --buffer
  short: -B
  arg: int
  default: "1"
  help: "Buffer up to this number of events before sending data for post-processing (1 effectively disables buffering)"
- long: --off-cpu-freq

  arg: int
  default: "1000"
  help: "Sampling frequency per second for off-CPU time profiling"
- long: --off-cpu-buffer
  short: -b
  arg: int
  default: "0"
  help: "Buffer up to this number of off-CPU events before sending data for post-processing (0 leaves the default adaptive buffering, 1 effectively disables buffering)"
- long: --post-process
  short: -p
  arg: int
  default: "1"
  help: "Number of threads isolated from profiled command to use for profilers and post-processing (must not be greater than the value of 'nproc' minus 3). Use 0 to not isolate profiler and post-processing threads from profiled command threads (NOT RECOMMENDED)."
- long: --server-buffer
  short: -s
  arg: int
  default: "1024"
  help: "Communication buffer size in bytes for internal adaptiveperf-server. Ignored when -a is used."
- long: --address
  short: -a
  arg: "address:port"
  help: "Delegate post-processing to another machine running adaptiveperf-server. All results will be stored on that machine."
- long: --warmup
  short: -w
  arg: int
  default: "1"
  help: "Warmup time in seconds between adaptiveperf-server signalling readiness for receiving data and starting the profiled program. Increase this value if you see missing information after profiling (note that adaptiveperf-server is also used internally if no -a option is specified)."
- long: --event
  short: -e
  arg: event,period,title
  repeatable: true
  help: "Extra perf event to be used for sampling with a given period (i.e. do a sample on every PERIOD occurrences of an event and display the results under the title TITLE in a website). Run \"perf list\" for the list of possible events. You can specify multiple events by specifying this flag more than once. Use quotes if you need to use spaces."
- long: --alternative
  short: -l
  help: "Use the alternative way of executing \"perf\". Specify this flag if you see missing information after profiling or profiling hangs/crashes."

examples:
- adaptiveperf ./a.out

- adaptiveperf --freq 5 -B 10 "python3 test_program.py"
